## Recommendations for Success

The definition of success can mean something different depending on the course. If you show up and engage with the material from the course, I will work with you to guide you to the goals and kinds of success you work to achieve. It is important to remember the [time requirements for a course](#time-requirement) for a course when making a plan for success.

Some prior knowledge of basic mathematics and number sense can help to increase your success.

Below are some other recommendations for success in an online course from [The Ohio State University](https://online.osu.edu/resources/learn/5-online-learning-tips-student-success) and the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/health/tips-succeeding-online-classes). Some of these recommendations are helpful and applicable to in-person courses as well.

1.	Treat your online courses the same as in-person classes.
2.	Familiarize yourself with the technology.
3.	Hold yourself accountable.
4.	Create a schedule and manage your time wisely.
5.	Stay organized and be thorough.
6.	Remain engaged throughout the whole course.
7.	Take care of yourself.
8.	Know where to turn for help.

(time-requirement)=
:::{note} Time Requirements of a College-level Course

The amount of time a student is expected to dedicate to studying and completing assignments for a specific course, typically includes class time, homework, reading, and preparation for exams. As guideline, for traditional, 16-week courses, one credit hour equates to three hours per week completing course activities. Therefore, if you are taking a 16-week course worth four credit hours, you should expect to spend 12 hours per week working in the course. This time allotment increases as the number of weeks of the course decreases. Below is a table showing examples of various hours per week that is recommended to devote to the course based on the length of the course. You should be aware that these are _suggested_ times based on the credit hours and the length of the course. Various factors such as previous knowledge, difficulty of material, and extracurricular activites may alter these times. There is not a one-size-fit-all approach or rule for planning your success in a college-level course. 

| Credit Hours | 4-week Course | 8-week Course | 12-week Course | 16-week Course |
| :----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| 1            | 12            | 6             | 4.5            | 3              |
| 2            | 24            | 12            | 9              | 6              |
| 3            | 36            | 18            | 13.5           | 9              |
| 4            | 48            | 24            | 18             | 12             |

### Assignment Descriptions

A brief description of assignments is provided below. Detailed information and requirements will be provided in class and/or online within the LMS. Each of the following assignments are expected to be submitted to their respective location within the LMS. No submission through email will be accepted.

**Homework.** Homework assignments will be given through MyOpenMath. MyOpenMath is an online learning platform that combines trusted author content with digital tools specifically designed to supplement mathematics textbooks and instruction. The questions in MyOpenMath are randomized for each student; therefore, it is highly unlikely that any two students will have the same exact MyOpenMath problems.

MyOpenMath assignments must be completed by the due date listed in MyOpenMath (which should be no later than the date of the unit test) in order to receive full credit. Students are able to receive 75 percent credit on any MyOpenMath problems completed after the due date. The final submission date to receive partial credit for MyOpenMath is the Last Day of Classes.

**Quizzes/Labs.** Students should expect quiz to consist of any combination of multiple choice and/or free response questions. Quizzes will be given in class and may be contain calculator inactive and calculator active portions. 

Lab assignments are to assess your ability to synthesize and apply the information learned in class. Unless otherwise stated by the instructor, lab assignments should be individual work. All work should be completed in a digital format that can be uploaded to Open LMS for grading. Some labs will require you to utlize Minitab for statistical analysis.

:::{warning}Submitting Labs for Grading

Only submissions submitted through the link in the LMS will be graded. Submissions sent via email will not be accepted or graded. If you experience issues submitting your lab assignments, please email your instructor as soon as possible. See [](#faculty-information) for your instructor's contact information.
:::

**Unit Exams.** Unit Exams will include multiple choice and/or free response questions. Note that any calculator with a computer algebra system such as a TI-89 or TI-Inspire are not be allowed on exams.

**Midterm.** The Midterm Exam will be given at the half-way point of the course and contain a calculator inactive and a calculator active portion. 

**Final Exam.** The Final Exam will be given at the conclusion of the course and contain a calculator inactive and a calculator active portion. The material covered on the Final Exam will consist of the units covered after the Midterm Exam.

### Missed Work

Any assignments not completed by the due date is considered late. See [](#late-work) policy.

(late-work)=
### Late Work

There are no make-ups for missed Labs, Quizzes, the Midterm Exam or the Final Exam unless arrangements are made with the instructor prior to the due date. Prior arrangements, except for extreme, extenuating circumstance, is considered to be 24 hours before the due date of the assignment for which an extension is being requested. In most cases, request for extensions after a due date will not be granted.

## Faculty Feedback and Response Time

### Grading and Feedback

For most assessments, you can generally expect feedback within seven days. The only exception to this feedback/response time would be when an institutional holiday occurs.

Feedback on your MyOpenMath will be automatically generated by the software. If you are unclear why you missed a problem, you should reach out to your instructor.

Feedback on all handwritten assignments such as quizzes and exams will be handwritten and returned either in class or electronically via the Learning Management System, depending on how the assignment was submitted.

## Attendance Policy

Mitchell Community College is an attendance taking institution. Instructors in all curriculum courses are required to report student attendance. Attendance begins on the first scheduled day of a course, even for students who register late. Mitchell Community College recognizes the connection between student attendance and student retention, achievement, and success. Students are expected to attend all class sessions, clinical experiences, and laboratory periods for which they are enrolled. Absence from any of these learning experiences, regardless of cause, reduces the opportunity for learning and may adversely affect a student’s achievement.

Students are responsible for class attendance and for any class work missed during an absence. When a student fails to comply with the attendance policy of the class or fails to attend for two consecutive weeks (14 consecutive calendar days), the instructor should process an administrative withdrawal for the student resulting in a grade of W.

### Mathematics Department Attendance Policy for Blended Courses

Attendance for this blended course is in two parts: online and seated.  You must be compliant with both components in order to remain in the class.

**Online component.** If you fail to be active in the course for 14 consecutive calendar days in the online component, then you will be withdrawn from the course.  

**Seated component.** If you fail to attend class for two consecutive weeks, then you will be withdrawn from the course.

:::{note}Defining Active Participation in a Blended Course
:class: dropdown

A blended courses consists of two modes of instruction: seated and online.

To be counted present for the seated component, you must phyiscally attend the scheduled course meeting.

For the online component, active participation can be derived from several components such as homework completion or lab submission. The following provides some guidance on active participation in the online component of the course.

Activities that **do** count towards active participation in the online component include
* Making progress in a MyOpenMath assignment for that week.
* Submitting a lab by the posted due date.

Activities that **do not** count towards active participation include
* Logging into the LMS without doing any of the above activities.
* Watching a lecture video.
* Clicking on an assignment, but not submitting any work.

## Mitchell Community College Inclement Weather Policy

In the event of adverse weather, the College will announce delays, cancellation of classes, or the closing of the college on local television and radio stations and on the [College website](https://www.mitchellcc.edu).

## No Show Date/Census Date Policy

In order to remain enrolled in a course, a student must attend class on or before the class census date. If a student does not attend class by the census date, they will be reported as a **“no show” (NS)** by the instructor and will be automatically withdrawn from the course.  To ensure students attend class and avoid being marked as a “no show”, students need to:

- For traditional 100% seated classes, a student must be physically present in class on or before the class census date.

- For blended or hybrid classes, a student must either complete the Enrollment Verification Activity (EVA) in the LMS or physically be present in class on or before the class census date.

- For 100% online classes, a student must complete the EVA in the LMS on or before the class census date.

If a student does not meet the census date requirement, the student must be reported as a no-show for the class. Students reported as a “no-show” are withdrawn from the class.  The no show date and the census date are the same date for a course and can be found on the course syllabus as well as on the [Office of Student Records webpage](https://mitchellcc.edu/office-student-records) (link opens in a new window). For blended, hybrid, and online courses this date is also noted in the EVA.

## Withdrawal Policy

The last day a student can withdraw from a course or from all courses with a grade of “W” is at the 75 percent point of the course. The exact date is published on the [Academic Calendar](https://www.mitchellcc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-2025-Academic-Calendar.pdf) (link opens in new window). After the 75 percent point of the course, the student can no longer initiate a withdrawal and will receive the grade earned in the course at the end of the term. Students can locate withdrawal information by visiting the Office of Student Records webpage or the [Schedule Adjustments and Class Withdrawals page](https://www.mitchellcc.edu/schedule-adjustments-and-class-withdrawals/). If they need to withdraw from **all** of their classes they can click on the “[Withdrawal Procedure](https://mitchellcc.edu/withdrawal-procedure)” menu link (links opens in a new window).

## Academic Dishonesty

Mitchell Community College makes every reasonable effort to maintain integrity in all academic programs. To compromise integrity through acts of academic dishonesty jeopardizes the quality of instruction and the caliber of education we aim to provide our students.  Any form of academic dishonesty, by any student at the College, is unacceptable and will result in disciplinary action.

Definitions and Examples of Academic Dishonesty include, but may not be limited to:  

**Cheating.** Intentionally and/or knowingly using unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise or matter.

**Plagiarism.** Intentionally and/or knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own in any academic exercise or matter.

**Fabrication.** Intentionally and/or knowingly falsifying or inventing information or citations in an academic exercise or matter.

**Facilitating Academic Dishonesty.** Intentionally and/or knowingly helping or attempting to help another to commit an act of cheating, plagiarism, or fabrication.

**Self-Plagiarism.** The use of one's own previous work in another context without citing that it was used previously. The writer should let the reader know that this was not the first use of the material.
