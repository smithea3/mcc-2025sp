You must purchase access to MyMathLab. See the Assignment Description of this syllabus for more information about MyMathLab.

## Scanner or Scanner Software

You will need to have access to a scanner or a scanner application on your mobile device in order to upload certain assignments for this course. There are several free scanner apps inside of the various “stores” for both Android and Apple devices. If you need assistance with scanning assignments onto your phone and uploading it to the respective place inside of OpenLMS, you will need to reach out to your instructor for assistance. 

## Teaching and Learning Strategies

Mitchell uses Contextual Teaching and Learning (CTL) to enhance student learning through activities that connect academic concepts to relevant life experiences.

## Learning Environment

The lectures, worksheets, and homework assignments are accessed through the online learning environment, OpenLMS. Except for the Midterm Exam and Final Exam, this course does not take place in real–time. Students are provided with content such as videos, worksheets, and tests that are given a time frame to complete. Interaction with each other and the instructor, in most cases, takes place through OpenLMS and email. As a result, there is no class meeting time (with the exception of the Midterm Exam and the Final Exam). Asynchronous online learning environments are effective for students with time constraints or busy schedules. However, is imperative that students in an online course follow the [Recommendations for Success](#recommendations-for-success) and seek out help and assistance when needed.

*	Homework and Reflections (15%)
*	Worksheets (15%)
*	Unit Tests (30%)
*	Midterm Exam (20%)
* Final Exam (20%)

### Assignment Descriptions

A brief description of assignments is provided below. Detailed information and requirements will be provided in class and/or online within the Learning Management System (LMS).

**Homework and Reflections.** Homework assignments will be given through MyMathLab. MyMathLab is an online learning platform that combines trusted author content with digital tools specifically designed to supplement mathematics textbooks and instruction. The questions in MyMathLab are randomized for each student; therefore, it is highly unlikely that any two students will have the same exact MyMathLab problems. MyMathLab assignments must be completed by the due date listed in MyMathLab (which should be no later than the date of the unit test) in order to receive full credit. Students are able to receive 75 percent credit on any MyMathLab problems completed after the due date. The final submission date to receive partial credit for MyMathLab is the Last Day of Classes. 

In addition to MyMathLab, reflections will be assigned for the purpose of being a reflective learner and ensuring constant engagement with the material each week. Students are expected to complete each reflection during the week it is assigned. The reflections are counted as a homework assignment in the calculation of your grade. A grading rubric for the reflections is available in the description of the reflection.

**Worksheets.** Students should expect worksheets questions to be any combination of multiple choice and/or free response. Worksheet assignments should be individual work. All written assignments should be neat and legible. Note that any calculator with a computer algebra system such as a TI-89 or TI-Inspire CAS will not be allowed on labs or worksheets. Worksheets must be scanned and uploaded to Open LMS to the correct assignment location to receive credit. No email submissions will be accepted or graded.

**Unit Tests.** Tests will be administered through MyMathLab. Tests will include multiple choice and/or free response questions. Each unit test has a time limit. The time limit for each test is posted in the description of the test and displayed when you click to attempt the test. Each test has a password. By entering the password of the unit test you are agreeing that you will abide by the Academic Integrity Policy as outline in the course syllabus and the Mitchell Community College Student Handbook. The password also acts as a safeguard against accidentally starting your test attempt. Any calculator with a computer algebra system such as a TI-89 or TI-Inspire are not be allowed on tests.

**Midterm.** Students are expected to come to campus to complete the Midterm Exam (see the course's description in Self-Service for finalized Midterm Exam dates). The Midterm Exam will cover the first half of the course (Units 1, 2, and 3). The Midterm Exam will contain two parts: a calculator inactive portion and a calculator active portion. 

**Final Exam.** Students are expected to come to campus to complete the Final Exam (see the course’s description in Self-Service for finalized Final Exam date). The Final Exam will contain materials from the second half of the course (Units 4, 5, and 6). The Final Exam will contain two parts: a calculator inactive portion and a calculator active portion.

### Missed Work

Any assignments not completed by the due date is considered late. See [Late Work](#late-work) policy.

### Late Work

There are no make-ups for missed Labs, Quizzes, the Midterm Exam, or the Final Exam unless arrangements are made with the instructor prior to the due date. Prior arrangements, except for extreme, extenuating circumstance, is considered to be 24 hours before the due date of the assignment for which an extension is being requested. In most cases, request for extensions after a due date will not be granted. 

For Unit Tests, students who request an extenstion within 48 hours (this includes 48 hours before and 48 hours after) the due date will be granted an extension not exceeding 48 hours.

## Faculty Feedback and Response Time

### Grading and Feedback

For most assessments, you can generally expect feedback within seven days. The only exception to this feedback/response time would be when an institutional holiday occurs.

Feedback on your MyMathLab will be automatically generated by the software. If you are unclear why you missed a problem, you should reach out to your instructor.

Feedback on all handwritten assignments such as in-class worksheets, quizzes, and tests will be handwritten and returned either in class or electronically via the Learning Management System.

## Attendance Policy

Mitchell Community College is an attendance taking institution. Instructors in all curriculum courses are required to report student attendance. Attendance begins on the first scheduled day of a course, even for students who register late. Mitchell Community College recognizes the connection between student attendance and student retention, achievement, and success. Students are expected to attend all class sessions, clinical experiences, and laboratory periods for which they are enrolled. Absence from any of these learning experiences, regardless of cause, reduces the opportunity for learning and may adversely affect a student’s achievement.

Students are responsible for class attendance and for any class work missed during an absence. The instructor’s policy on make-up work must be clearly stated in the class syllabus. Obtaining and making up missed work is the student’s responsibility.

When a student fails to comply with the attendance policy of the class or fails to attend for two consecutive weeks (14 consecutive calendar days), the instructor should process an administrative withdrawal for the student resulting in a grade of W.

### Mathematics Department Attendance Policy for Online Courses

If a student fails to be active in the course for 14 consecutive calendar days, then they will be withdrawn from the course.

## Mitchell Community College Inclement Weather Policy

In the event of adverse weather, the College will announce delays, cancellation of classes, or the closing of the college on local television and radio stations and on the [College website](https://www.mitchellcc.edu).

## No Show Date/Census Date Policy

In order to remain enrolled in a course, a student must attend class on or before the class census date. If a student does not attend class by the census date, they will be reported as a **“no show” (NS)** by the instructor and will be automatically withdrawn from the course.  To ensure students attend class and avoid being marked as a “no show”, students need to:

- For traditional 100% seated classes, a student must be physically present in class on or before the class census date.

- For blended or hybrid classes, a student must either complete the Enrollment Verification Activity (EVA) in the LMS or physically be present in class on or before the class census date.

- For 100% online classes, a student must complete the EVA in the LMS on or before the class census date.

If a student does not meet the census date requirement, the student must be reported as a no-show for the class. Students reported as a “no-show” are withdrawn from the class.  The no show date and the census date are the same date for a course and can be found on the course syllabus as well as on the [Office of Student Records webpage](https://mitchellcc.edu/office-student-records) (link opens in a new window). For blended, hybrid, and online courses this date is also noted in the EVA.

## Withdrawal Policy

The last day a student can withdraw from a course or from all courses with a grade of “W” is at the 75 percent point of the course. The exact date is published on the [Academic Calendar](https://www.mitchellcc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-2025-Academic-Calendar.pdf) (link opens in new window). After the 75 percent point of the course, the student can no longer initiate a withdrawal and will receive the grade earned in the course at the end of the term. Students can locate withdrawal information by visiting the Office of Student Records webpage or the [Schedule Adjustments and Class Withdrawals page](https://www.mitchellcc.edu/schedule-adjustments-and-class-withdrawals/). If they need to withdraw from **all** of their classes they can click on the “[Withdrawal Procedure](https://mitchellcc.edu/withdrawal-procedure)” menu link (links opens in a new window).

## Academic Dishonesty

Mitchell Community College makes every reasonable effort to maintain integrity in all academic programs. To compromise integrity through acts of academic dishonesty jeopardizes the quality of instruction and the caliber of education we aim to provide our students.  Any form of academic dishonesty, by any student at the College, is unacceptable and will result in disciplinary action.

Definitions and Examples of Academic Dishonesty include, but may not be limited to:  

**Cheating:** Intentionally and/or knowingly using unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise or matter.

**Plagiarism:** Intentionally and/or knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own in any academic exercise or matter.

**Fabrication:** Intentionally and/or knowingly falsifying or inventing information or citations in an academic exercise or matter.

**Facilitating Academic Dishonesty:** Intentionally and/or knowingly helping or attempting to help another to commit an act of cheating, plagiarism, or fabrication.

**Self-Plagiarism:** The use of one's own previous work in another context without citing that it was used previously. The writer should let the reader know that this was not the first use of the material.

## Tentative Schedule

A tentative schdule of due dates for all assessments of learning are posted in the LMS. Dates, assigned readings and/or assessments are subject to change. The instructor will notify students of any change through email and the Announcements section of the Learning Management System (LMS) class site.
