:::{important} Reminder of Meetings
This is a reminder that this class in a synchronous class where the instructor is in-person in Statesville (VB 106) on Monday and Tuesday and in-person on Mooresville (Tice 109) on Wednesday and Thursday. The other section of the course is still expected to attend in-person and the instructor will appear virtually using the audio-visual equipment in the classroom.
